            <h3>Use Roll20?</h3>
            <p>Get Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome). Install the script using this <a
                    href="https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/5etoolsR20/raw/master/5etoolsR20.user.js">link</a>! This
                userscript allows you to import much of 5etools' data without paying a dime. If you are using the Shaped
                sheet, be sure to open up the NPC sheets and let them convert before using it. NOTE: It only imports
                when you're a DM.</p>
            <h3>Use Discord?</h3>
            <p>Now you can join our server using <a href="https://discord.gg/v3AXzcW">this</a> link!</p>
            <h3>FAQ / Help</h3>
            <p><b>Browser Support.</b> We aim to fully support <b>all</b> commonly used browsers, i.e. Chrome and
                Firefox. We have no plans to support any Microsoft browsers. Other browsers, e.g. Safari and Opera,
                might work OK but you may wish to upgrade to a better browser in order to have a better experience when
                using the internet.</p>
            <p><b>Device Support.</b> We aim to support Windows and Android; mainly because they're the devices we
                usually have access to. Due to the amount of information displayed we typically aim for the best
                look-and-feel when using a monitor rather than a smartphone screen. Similar to our browser support, you
                may wish to upgrade to a better supported device in order to have a more secure / better experience when
                using the internet.</p>
            <p><b>Filtering.</b> On most of the pages we have filters. By default we include and/or exclude certain
                things. The filter will include anything that's blue and exclude anything that's red. For example, if
                you want to see all spells from Xanathar's Guide to Everything that a Warlock can use but can't be used
                by a Wizard then you need to have "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" and "Warlock" in blue and "Wizard" in
                red - when you're in the Filter drop-down clicking an icon cycles the color from white (it doesn't
                matter either way) to blue (include these things) to red (exclude these things). If you get lost then
                simply click the Reset button and the filtering will go back to the default for that page.</p>
            <p><b>Everything keeps changing.</b> Yes - it does; that's because we want to keep improving this site. We
                rarely delete data, but it may appear to be "missing"; that's often due to the filter settings. If you
                find entries are wrong then please let us know, e.g. using Discord or raise an issue in GitHub; we're
                typically very responsive. Similarly, if you have any good suggestions for improvements then we're up
                for that too! No change is too small to tell us about, e.g. spelling mistakes and links not working, but
                the bigger changes might take some time to get to the top of our priority list.</p>
            <p><b>Links.</b> Much of the content includes hyperlinks to other parts of our site. Similarly, other things
                may look like links but they're often die-rollers, e.g. click on a 1d4+2 and we'll do the dice rolling
                for you and the results appear at the bottom of the screen. If in doubt, give it a click and see what it
                does!</p>
            <p><b>Day/Night Mode.</b> Night Mode, with a dark background and lighter text, is a relatively recent new
                feature and we're still putting the finishing touches to its look-and-feel.</p>
            <p><b>Sorting.</b> If you click on the column name in a table then the data in that column is sorted;
                clicking on it again will reverse the sort direction. Where possible, we've tried to be logical about
                the sorting, e.g. Self then touch then various distances then Unlimited and Special at the far end; some
                of the sorting is still work-in-progress - if you have any good ideas on how to improve it please let us
                know, e.g. sorting by Ability in Feats.</p>
            <p><b>Hover.</b> Some of the things on the page will pop-up a tooltip if you hover the mouse over them, e.g.
                our source abbreviations will pop-up with the full name of the source. Actions and skill checks also
                have tooltips on some pages.</p>
