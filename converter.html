Innate Spellcasting. Mammon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: charm person, detect magic, dispel magic, fabricate (Mammon can create valuable objects), heat metal, magic aura
3/day each: animate objects, counterspell, creation, instant summons, legend lore, teleport
1/day each: imprisonment (minimus containment only, inside gems), sunburst
Legendary Resistance (3/day). If Mammon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Resistance. Mammon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Magic Weapons. Mammon's weapon attacks are magical.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. Mammon makes three attacks.
Purse. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.
Molten Coins. Ranged Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage.
Your Weight In Gold (Recharge 5-6). Mammon can use this ability as a bonus action immediately after hitting a creature with his purse attack. The creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified by being turned to solid gold. Otherwise, a creature that fails the saving throw is restrained. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.
LEGENDARY ACTIONS
Mammon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Mammon regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
Attack. Mammon makes one purse or molten coins attack.
Make It Rain! Mammon casts gold and jewels into a 5-foot radius within 60 feet. One creature within 60 feet of the treasure that can see it must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature must use its reaction to move its speed toward the trinkets, which vanish at the end of the turn.
Deep Pockets (3 actions). Mammon recharges his Your Weight In Gold ability.</textarea>
