## Running 5etools Locally (Offline Copy)
There are several options for running a local/offline copy of 5etools, including:

**Beginner:** Use Firefox to open the files.

**Intermediate:** When using Chrome (or similar), a command-line switch is required to load some pages locally. On Windows, this can be accomplished by creating a Chrome shortcut and editing the properties of the shortcut to add `--allow-file-access-from-files` to the shortcut `Target`:

Be sure to close any running Chrome instances (and kill any remaining Chrome processes as required) before opening the shortcut. A summary of the security implications can be found [here](https://superuser.com/a/873527).
 
**Advanced:** Host the project locally on a dev webserver, perhaps using [this](https://github.com/cortesi/devd).

## How to import 5etools creatures/spells/items into Roll20
1. Get Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome).

2. Click [here](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/5etoolsR20/raw/master/5etoolsR20.user.js) and install the script.

3. Open the Roll20 game where you want the stuff imported.

4. Go to the gear icon and click on the things you want imported.

5. Let it run. The journal will start fill up with the stuff you selected. It's not too laggy but can take a long time depending on the amount of stuff you selected.

6. Bam. Done. If you are using the Shaped sheet, be sure to open up the NPC sheets and let them convert before using it.

You can convert stat blocks to JSON for importing via [this converter](converter.html).

## Dev Notes

### Style Guidelines
- Use tabs over spaces.

### JSON Cleaning
#### Trailing commas
To remove trailing commas in JSON:

Find: `(.*?)(,)(:?\s*]|\s*})`

Replace: `$1$3`

#### Character replacement
- `’` should be replaced with `'`
- `“` and `”` should be replaced with `"`
- `—` (em dash) should be replaced with `\u2014` (Unicode for em dash). This character should be used for parenthetical dash pairs, or for marking empty table rows.
- `–` should be replaced with `\u2013` (Unicode for en dash). This character should be used for joining numerical ranges, e.g. `1-5` should become `1\u20135`. 
- `−` should be replaced with `\u2212` (Unicode for minus sign). This character should be used for unary minus signs, in the case of penalties. For example, `"You have a -5 penalty to..."` should become `"You have a \u22125 penalty to..."`.
	- Note: Regular dash characters should generally only be used for hyphenation.
- `•` should be not be used unless the JSON in question is not yet covered by the entryRenderer, i.e. should be encoded as a list
- the only Unicode escape sequences allowed are `\u2014` and `\u2013`; all other characters (unless noted above) should be stored as-is

#### Convention for dashes
- `-` (hyphen) should **only** be used to hyphenate words, e.g. `60-foot` and `18th-level`
- any whitespace on any side of a `\u2014` should be removed

#### Convention for measurement
- Adjectives: a hyphen and the full name of the unit of measure should be used, e.g. dragon exhales acid in a `60-foot line`
- Nouns: a space and the short name of the unit of measure (including the trailing period) should be used, e.g. `blindsight 60 ft.`, `darkvision 120 ft.`
- Time: a slash, `/`, with no spaces on either side followed by the capitalised unit of time, e.g. `2/Turn`, `3/Day`

##### Misc

- A handy dice regex: `([1-9]\d*)?d([1-9]\d*)(\s?([+-])\s?(\d+))?` (and to output as tagged dice in the basic case: `{@dice $1d$2$4$5}`)

### Dev Server

Do `npm run dev-server` to launch a local dev server that serves the project files on [`http://localhost:8080/5etools.html`](http://localhost:8080/5etools.html).

The server automatically refreshes the page for you whenever one of the project files (html, css, js, images) changes.

### Version bump

Do `npm run version-bump -- [OPTION]`, where `[OPTION]` is one of the following:

- `major` to increment the major version (`1.2.3` will become `2.0.0`)
- `minor` to increment the minor version (`1.2.3` will become `1.3.0`)
- `patch` to increment the patch version (`1.2.3` will become `1.2.4`)
- a version number (like `1.2.3`)

It will first run the tests and fail to increase the version if the tests fail.  
It will then automatically replace the version in the files where it needs to be replaced, create a commit with the message `chore(version): bump` and create a tag (in the form `v1.2.3`) at the commit.  
This feature can be easily disabled by doing `npm config set git-tag-version false`.
