It can bring cocooned victims along with it, but they have no special capacity for breathing while underground. Getting into the ground, however, is not as easy for the cerebral stalker as moving underground. It must spend four moves on four rounds (no dashing) melding into the ground. On the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; on the second round, to its waist; on the third round, to its neck; and on the fourth round, the stalker and any creature it has cocooned disappear completely underground. Melding into the ground does not provoke an opportunity attack. If the cerebral stalker is grappled while sinking into the ground, it must win a Str contest against its grapplers to sink farther that round.

Each time the golden cat grants luck (a reroll) to its owner, it saps a bit of luck from other, nearby creatures. All other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat have tactical disadvantage on their first attack roll or ability check for one round."

Each failed saving throw adds one more level of exhaustion; a successful saving throw at the end of a long rest means only that the character's condition doesn't worsen. The character recovers fully when he or she makes successful saving throws at the ends of two consecutive long rests or when lesser restoration or comparable magic is used on the character."

Scattering or even destroying the pieces of its body don't prevent it from magically reassembling and reanimating.
