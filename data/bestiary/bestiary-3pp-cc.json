If the creature was a Small or Tiny humanoid, the banderhobb mother regurgitates a banderhobb filch 1d4 rounds after it died. A newly spawned banderhobb filch cannot use its sack action until it acquired a sack or other bag large enough to hold the creature it intends to sack. If the creature was not a humanoid, it transforms into a lifeless, deformed mass of flesh vaguely resembling banderhobb features and is regurgitated dead. The banderhobb mother must use its action to do so and cannot choose not to regurgitate a banderhobb, once it is fully gestated. The banderhobb mother will regurgitate a banderhobb even when it is incapacitated or otherwise prevented from taking an action, unless it is frozen, petrified, or otherwise suspended in a similar state of stasis. When the banderhobb mother regurgitates a creature, that creature exits prone in a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb mother. If the banderhobb mother dies, any swallowed creatures are likewise regurgitated. The banderhobb mother can only have one Medium or Large creature, or up to two Small or smaller creatures swallowed at a time. If multiple swallowed creatures die at the same time, roll for each individually to see how long it takes for them to transform into banderhobbs."

The harpoon spider can have up to six Medium or smaller creatures impaled on its backspikes."
